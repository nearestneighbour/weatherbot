Hi, this is a simple Telegram bot that gives the current weather at a specified location. It is ready for deployment on the [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) cloud platform. The following APIs are used to retrieve data:
* [Here.com](https://developer.here.com/documentation) API for maps and locations
* [OpenWeatherMap.org](https://openweathermap.org/api) API for weather data

In order to deploy this app, you need Heroku with PostgreSQL, a Telegram bot token, python3 and a bunch of dependencies specified in requirements.txt. More info on setup, configuration and running the app locally or in the cloud will come soon.
